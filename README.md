Welcome! 
This repository is for people who are new to python and want to make simple python scripts or games.
I have included many different scripts like a dice roll and how to use something.
I will keep uploading different scripts for you to use, and there is no need to credit me in your projects as this is 
simple code. The higher the script is on the list, the harder it is. There is lots of notes explaning what the code does, breaking it down into simple terms. Hope you enjoy!
Have fun coding!
