Welcome! 
This repository is for people who are new to python and want to make simple python scripts or games.
I have included many different scripts like a dice roll and how to use something like: number = random.randint(1,100)
I will keep uploading different scripts for you to use, and there is no need to credit me in your projects as this is 
simple code. 
Have fun coding!
